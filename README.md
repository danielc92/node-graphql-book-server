# GraphQL Javascript Server
Backend server for book app, using MongoDB, Mongoose, GraphQL and Nodejs.

### Running the server

From root project directory.

```sh
nodemon server.js
```

### Requirements

This server runs on Node. The version of Node I used was `v10.16.0`.

I also installed a MongoDB instance locally, more instructions on that can be found on the official mongodb documentation.

The requirements are shown in package.json and can be installed via

```sh
npm install
```
